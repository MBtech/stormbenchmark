# Storm's Automatic Parameter tuning [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intel-hadoop/storm-benchmark.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intel-hadoop/storm-benchmark?branch=master)

### Note: The repository is going through major overhaul and refractoring to make it ease to use. Further documentation will be added along with refractoring process. Current version of the system can be used by following the guide in `tuning/README.md`

## Benchmark
The benchmarking framework is main based on the [Intel storm benchmark](https://github.com/intel-hadoop/storm-benchmark). We have added several other benchmarking applications as well.

## Automatic Parameter Tuning
The automatic parameter tuning for the example topologies can be experimented with using the guide available in `tuning/README.md`.
There is some ongoing work regarding addition of new black box algorithms for optimization. More information on the new algorithms will be added as they are tested and pushed into the repo.
