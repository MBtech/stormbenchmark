# Storm's Automatic Parameter tuning [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/intel-hadoop/storm-benchmark.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/intel-hadoop/storm-benchmark?branch=master)

## Note: The repository is going through major overhaul and refractoring to make it ease to use. Further documentation will be added along with refractoring process

## Benchmark
The benchmarking framework is main based on the [Intel storm benchmark](https://github.com/intel-hadoop/storm-benchmark). We have added several other benchmarking applications as well.

## Automatic Parameter Tuning
The automatic parameter tuning is available along with the benchmark examples to test the different auto tuning algorithms that we have implement.
